    <p> First Paragraph Tropical in India, evergreen forests dominate the natural vegetation They thrive <br>in areas with more than 200 cm of rainfall. Evergreen forests are critical not only for promoting<br> greenery on the planet but also for the survival of animals and plants in the forest ecosystem rare<br> Because there is no drought, the trees are evergreen. They’re mostly tall and made of hardwood.<br>Tropical evergreen forests are found in the Western Ghats, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands,the<br>upper parts of Assam, and the coasts of Tamil Nadu, India. These forests are characterized by high<br>rainfall, dense vegetation, and a wide variety of plant and animal life. These forests are primarily<br> composed of Ebony, Mahogany, and Rosewood. There are many different plants and animals that<br> coexist with one another to ensure the survival of the species. The coexistence of plants and animals.<br> results in the existence of a biome.</p>

However, as human activity has increased, these forests have <br>been reduced to a delta of rivers such as the Ganga, Godavari, Mahanadi, Yamuna, and others.<br> The Western Ghats forests extend across Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala, Goa, and parts of<br> Tamil Nadu. The mangroves of the Ganga delta (West Bengal) are one of the world’s largest<br>tidal forests, and the name comes from the Sundari tree that grows in its muddy areas Many<br> tropical evergreen forests are now semi-evergreen, possibly due to increased human-to-animal</p>

The forests which are evergreen are<br>essential in not only promoting greenery on the planet but, on the other hand, they are also<br> useful in the continual survival of animals and plants in the forest ecosystem.It is a very<br> important species found in these forests: these are the Rosewood, the Mahogany, the Aini,<br> the Ebony, etc. these are also important species in Kerala are Mesa, which is the White cedar,<br> the Jamun, and Canes, etc. There is a very common species found in Assam forests: the Gurjan,<br> Jamun, Agar, Bamboo, etc.These forests are found in the northeastern states of India, such as<br>Assam, Meghalaya, and Arunachal Pradesh. They are characterized by high rainfall and humidity.<br> The trees in these forests are typically tall and have evergreen leaves.
