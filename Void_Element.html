    <p>William Blake (28 November 1757 â€“ 12 August 1827) was an English poet, painter, and <br>printmaker. Largely unrecognised during his life, Blake is now considered a seminal figure in<br> the history of the poetry and visual art of the Romantic Age. What he called his "prophetic <br>works" were said by 20th-century critic Northrop Frye to form "what is in proportion to its <br>merits the least read body of poetry in the English language".[2] His visual artistry led 21st<br>-century critic Jonathan Jones to proclaim him "far and away the greatest artist Britain has ever<br> produced".[3] In 2002, Blake was placed at number 38 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest<br> Britons.[4] While he lived in London his entire life, except for three years spent in Felpham,<br>[5] he produced a diverse and symbolically rich collection of works, which embraced the<br> imagination as "the body of God"[6] or "human existence itself".[7] </p>
    <p>Although Blake was considered mad by contemporaries for his idiosyncratic views, he came to<br> be highly regarded by later critics and readers for his expressiveness and creativity, and for the <br>philosophical and mystical undercurrents within his work. His paintings and poetry have been <br>characterised as part of the Romantic movement and as "Pre-Romantic".[8] A committed Chri<br>stian who was hostile to the Church of England (indeed, to almost all forms of organised religi<br>on), Blake was influenced by the ideals and ambitions of the French and American revolutions.<br>[9][10] Though later he rejected many of these political beliefs, he maintained an amicable rela<br>tionship with the political activist Thomas Paine; he was also influenced by thinkers such as <br>Emanuel Swedenborg.[11] Despite these known influences, the singularity of Blake's work makes<br> him difficult to classify. The 19th-century scholar William Michael Rossetti characterised him as<br> a "glorious luminary",[12] and "a man not forestalled by predecessors, nor to be classed with<br> contemporaries, nor to be replaced by known or readily surmisable successors".[13]
